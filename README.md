# CNN_in_CIFAR-10
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 categories: airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and includes several enhancements to improve accuracy and generalization.
